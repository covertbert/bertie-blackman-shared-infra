# Shared AWS Infrastructure

![Deploy](https://github.com/covertbert/covertbert-bertie-blackman-shared-infra/workflows/Deploy/badge.svg)

This repo is for my shared AWS infrastructure, written in TypeScript & using the AWS CDK.

## Getting started

Available stacks can be found in `bin/main.ts`.

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `yarn synth <stack-name>` to see a simulated output of the specified stack
- `yarn deploy <stack-name>` to deploy a specific stack
